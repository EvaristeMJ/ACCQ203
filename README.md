## ACCQ203

ACCQ203 is a computer algebra course at Telecom Paris. It is taught by Bertrand Meyer.

In this repository, you will find the course material, mostly the lecture notes.

The TP directory contains the assignment for each practical session. The assignment is in the form of a Jupyter notebook. It is mainly exercises where I had to rewrite famous algorithms in algebra and cryptography.
